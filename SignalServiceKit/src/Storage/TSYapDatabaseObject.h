#pragma mark Update With...

// This method is used by "updateWith..." methods.
//
// This model may be updated from many threads. We don't want to save
// our local copy (this instance) since it may be out of date.  We also
// want to avoid re-saving a model that has been deleted.  Therefore, we
// use "updateWith..." methods to:
//
// a) Update a property of this instance.
// b) If a copy of this model exists in the database, load an up-to-date copy,
//    and update and save that copy.
// b) If a copy of this model _DOES NOT_ exist in the database, do _NOT_ save
//    this local instance.
//
// After "updateWith...":
//
// a) Any copy of this model in the database will have been updated.
// b) The local property on this instance will always have been updated.
// c) Other properties on this instance may be out of date.
//
// All mutable properties of this class have been made read-only to
// prevent accidentally modifying them directly.
//
// This isn't a perfect arrangement, but in practice this will prevent
// data loss and will resolve all known issues.
